# Code

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks for the models implemented in the COVID-19 mask detection project. The project explores different classification models to determine whether individuals are wearing masks properly, improperly, or not at all. The notebooks provided are:

- **Code.ipynb**: Main file with shared functions and utilities.
- **cnn.ipynb**: Implementation of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
- **hog-kNN.ipynb**: K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) model using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features.
- **hog-mlp.ipynb**: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model utilizing HOG features.
- **hog-svm.ipynb**: Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained with HOG features.
