## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a COVID-19 mask detection dataset, containing images labeled as "mask," "no_mask," and "improper_mask." The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with images resized to 224x224x3 RGB format. Preprocessing steps include resizing and label encoding.

## 🧠 Implemented Models

1. **🔲 Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Utilizes HOG features to classify images. Optimized with an RBF kernel.
2. **🔲 Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**: HOG features with a neural network structure, optimized using GridSearchCV.
3. **🔲 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Simple, non-parametric model trained on HOG features, optimized for the best `k` value.
4. **🔲 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: End-to-end deep learning model directly trained on images for higher accuracy.

Each model is evaluated on performance metrics including accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.

## 📈 Results

The CNN model achieved the highest accuracy (92.79% 🏆), demonstrating superior performance in detecting mask usage compared to the HOG-based models. The detailed results, including performance metrics and discussion on model biases, can be found in the report under `Models/Computer Vision Report.pdf`.
